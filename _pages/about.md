I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan where I study Data Science and Chemical Engineering. My interests span machine learning, computer vision, statistics, and the physical sciences. Specifically, I'm interested in developing domain-informed, physics-guided machine learning techniques for climate and fluid flow prediction, solving partial differential equations, and other scientific computing applications. 

Most recently I was a research intern at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/){:target="\_blank"} and [Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/){:target="\_blank"} on memory-efficient multigrid convolutional neural operators for weather and fluid flow prediction .
I also represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions, for which we developed adversarial [super-resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbwTb7DNe0vRZiN9hg53W5MZdRbXJqsg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} methods for global climate methods.
Before this, I worked on semantic segmentation for defect detection in semiconductor fabrication, and I've also done research in computational immunology and anomaly detection for electric grids.

I'm an incoming Computer Science PhD student at UC Berkeley in Berkeley AI Research [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I received undergraduate degrees in Chemical Engineering and Data Science from the University of Michigan.

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and the natural sciences. On the applied side, I am interested in combining the expressivity of modern deep neural networks with the generalization capabilities of first-principles scientific models to improve partial differential equation solvers, molecular and fluid dynamics simulations, and other scientific computing workflows. On the fundamental side, I am interested in understanding how scientific inductive biases (e.g conservation or equivariance constraints) impact the generalization capabilities of machine learning models in both data-limited and data-rich settings.
