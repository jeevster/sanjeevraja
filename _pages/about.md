I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan where I study Data Science and Chemical Engineering. My interests span machine learning, computer vision, statistics, and the physical sciences. Specifically, I'm interested in developing domain-informed, physics-guided machine learning techniques for climate and fluid flow prediction, solving partial differential equations, and other scientific computing applications. 

Most recently I was a research intern at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/){:target="\_blank"} and [Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/){:target="\_blank"} on memory-efficient multigrid convolutional neural operators for weather and fluid flow prediction .
I also represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions, for which we developed adversarial [super-resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbwTb7DNe0vRZiN9hg53W5MZdRbXJqsg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} methods for global climate methods.
Before this, I worked on semantic segmentation for defect detection in semiconductor fabrication, and I've also done research in computational immunology and anomaly detection for electric grids.
