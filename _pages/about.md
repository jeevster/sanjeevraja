I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Berkeley AI Research [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/){:target="\_blank"} advised by [Aditi Krishnapriyan](https://a1k12.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and the natural sciences. On the applied side, I am interested in combining the expressivity of modern deep neural networks with the generalization capabilities of first-principles scientific models to improve partial differential equation solvers, molecular and fluid dynamics simulations, and other scientific computing workflows. On the fundamental side, I am interested in understanding how scientific inductive biases (e.g conservation or equivariance constraints) impact the generalization capabilities of machine learning models in both data-limited and data-rich settings.

Most recently I was a research intern at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/){:target="\_blank"} and [Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/){:target="\_blank"} on memory-efficient multigrid [neural operators for weather and fluid flow prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214){:target="\_blank"}.
I also represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions, for which we developed adversarial [super-resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbwTb7DNe0vRZiN9hg53W5MZdRbXJqsg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} methods for global climate methods.
