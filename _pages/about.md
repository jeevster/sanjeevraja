I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Berkeley AI Research [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/){:target="\_blank"} advised by [Aditi Krishnapriyan](https://a1k12.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and the molecular sciences, with a particular focus on developing ML methods to accelerate [molecular dynamics simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics){:target="\_blank"}. More broadly, I am interested in combining the expressivity of modern deep neural networks with the generalization capabilities of first-principles scientific models to improve scientific computing worflows.

In the past, I worked on ML for climate simulations. I have been a research intern at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Jaideep Pathak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cevw0gkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="\_blank"} and [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/){:target="\_blank"} on [FourCastNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214){:target="\_blank"}, which was a state-of-the-art weather prediction model at the time.
I also represented my university in [ProjectX](https://www.projectx2020.com/){:target="\_blank"}, an international research competition on ML for climate change solutions, for which we developed adversarial [super-resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbwTb7DNe0vRZiN9hg53W5MZdRbXJqsg/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} methods for global climate simulations.
