Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13984){:target="\_blank"} and [talk](https://portal.valencelabs.com/events/post/stability-aware-training-of-neural-network-interatomic-potentials-with-Q57mBP1eAwbOqpe){:target="\_blank"} introducing StABlE, a multi-modal approach for training stable machine learning force fields that combines supervision from quantum-mechanical energies/forces and system observables!
